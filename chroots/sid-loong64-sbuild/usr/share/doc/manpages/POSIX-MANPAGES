As of version 1.65 of man-pages, the upstream project this package is
based on, manual pages from the POSIX standard are included.  The
man-pages project is permitted to distribute them and Andries Brouwer
assumes that re-distribution by vendors is permitted as well.

However, modification is definitively not allowed, hence this great
contribution by The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers
and The Open Group (see <http://linuxpr.com/releases/6599.html>)
rendered the entire man-pages package non-free.

As of 1.66-1 release of the Debian package, the Debian maintainer
decided to strip non-free POSIX manual pages from manpages tarball.
In this way, this package continued to live in the main archive.

Francesco Paolo Lovergine <frankie@debian.org> has packaged the
non-free POSIX manpages as manpages-posix which are distributed by the
Debian project in the non-free archive.

Since 3.00 release (November'06), those POSIX manpages were
removed by upstream and allocated in a separated tarball. Therefore it
was no longer necessary to strip them.
