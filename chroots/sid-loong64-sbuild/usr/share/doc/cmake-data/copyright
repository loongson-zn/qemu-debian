  is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the editorial revisions,
  annotations, elaborations, or other modifications represent, as a whole, an

  shall not include works that remain separable from, or merely link (or bind by
  name) to the interfaces of, the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
  .
  "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including the original
  version of the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work or

  2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
  License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide,
  non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to
  reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform,
  sublicense, and distribute the Work and such Derivative Works in Source or
  Object form.
  .
  3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
  License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide,
  non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this
  section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import,
  and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those
  patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by
  their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with
  the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent
  litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a
  lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work
  constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent
  licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of
  the date such litigation is filed.
  .
  4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or
  Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in
  Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:
  .
  You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of
  this License; and
  You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You
  changed the files; and
  You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You
  distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the
  Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any
  part of the Derivative Works; and
  If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution, then
  any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the
  attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices
  that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of
  the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the
  Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along
  with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative
  Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the
  License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that
  You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work,
  provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as
  modifying the License.
  .
  You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide
  additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or
  distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a
  whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise
  complies with the conditions stated in this License.
  .
  5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any
  Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the
  Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any
  additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein
  shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may
  have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
  .
  6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names,
  trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as
  required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work
  and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
  .
  7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in
  writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its
  Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY
  KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties
  or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
  PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
  appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks
  associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
  .
  8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in
  tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by
  applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in
  writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any
  direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any
  character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability
  to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
  work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other
  commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of
  the possibility of such damages.
  .
  9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work
  or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for,
  acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations
  and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such
  obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole
  responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree
  to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
  incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your
  accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
